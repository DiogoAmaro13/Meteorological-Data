# Meteorological-Data
Provide any city and get the main parameters of the current meteorological state of that city.
The program uses an API and proceeds to make a request to that API key to extract the data. 




Note: to avoid malpractice, the user is the one providing both the API key and the url of that API.
Suggestion: If you want to try it with different cities, I recommend you store both the API key and the API url in two variables so you avoid copy and paste them repeteadly.
