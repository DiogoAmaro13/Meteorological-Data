# Meteorological-Data
Provide any city and get the main parameters of the current meteorological state of that city.
The program uses an API and proceeds to make a request to that API key to extract the data. 




Note: to avoid malpractice, the user is the one providing both the API key and the url of that API. <br />
Suggestion: If you want to try it with different cities, I recommend you replace the API key input and the API url input with the actual API key and the API url, respectively, to avoid inputing them repeteadly.
